It allows users to evaluate their models on large amounts of data in a\ndistributed manner, using the same metrics defined in their trainer. These\nmetrics can be computed over different slices of data and visualized in Jupyter\nnotebooks.\n\n![TFMA Slicing Metrics Browser](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorflow/model-analysis/master/g3doc/images/tfma-slicing-metrics-browser.gif)\n\nCaution: TFMA may introduce backwards incompatible changes before version 1.0.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe recommended way to install TFMA is using the\n[PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow-model-analysis/):\n\n<pre class=\"devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy\">\npip install tensorflow-model-analysis\n</pre>\n\npip install from https://pypi-nightly.tensorflow.org\n\n<pre class=\"devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy\">\npip install -i https://pypi-nightly.tensorflow.org/simple tensorflow-model-analysis\n</pre>\n\npip install from the HEAD of the git:\n\n<pre class=\"devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy\">\npip install git+https://github.com/tensorflow/model-analysis.git#egg=tensorflow_model_analysis\n</pre>\n\npip install from a released version directly from git:\n\n<pre class=\"devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy\">\npip install git+https://github.com/tensorflow/model-analysis.git@v0.21.3#egg=tensorflow_model_analysis\n</pre>\n\nIf you have cloned the repository locally, and want to test your local change,\npip install from a local folder.\n\n<pre class=\"devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy\">\npip install -e $FOLDER_OF_THE_LOCAL_LOCATION\n</pre>\n\nNote that protobuf must be installed correctly for the above option since it is\nbuilding TFMA from source and it requires protoc and all of its includes\nreference-able. Please see [protobuf install instruction](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf#protocol-compiler-installation)\nfor see the latest install instructions.\n\nCurrently, TFMA requires that TensorFlow is installed but does not have an\nexplicit dependency on the TensorFlow PyPI package. See the\n[TensorFlow install guides](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) for\ninstructions.\n\n### Build TFMA from source\n\nTo build from source follow the following steps:\n\nInstall the protoc as per the link mentioned:\n[protoc](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/#install-pre-compiled-binaries-any-os)\n\nCreate a virtual environment by running the commands\n\n```\npython3 -m venv <virtualenv_name>\nsource <virtualenv_name>/bin/activate\npip3 install setuptools wheel\ngit clone https://github.com/tensorflow/model-analysis.git\ncd model-analysis\npython3 setup.py bdist_wheel\n```\nThis will build the TFMA wheel in the dist directory. To install the wheel from\ndist directory run the commands\n\n```\ncd dist\npip3 install tensorflow_model_analysis-<version>-py3-none-any.whl\n```\n\n### Jupyter Lab\n\nAs of writing, because of https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9187, `pip install`\nmight never finish. In that case, you should revert pip to version 19 instead of\n20: `pip install \"pip<20\"`.\n\nUsing a JupyterLab extension requires installing dependencies on the command\nline. You can do this within the console in the JupyterLab UI or on the command\nline. This includes separately installing any pip package dependencies and\nJupyterLab labextension plugin dependencies, and the version numbers must be\ncompatible.  JupyterLab labextension packages refer to npm packages\n(eg, [tensorflow_model_analysis](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tensorflow_model_analysis).\n\nThe examples below use 0.32.0. Check available [versions](#compatible-versions)\nbelow to use the latest.\n\n\n#### Jupyter Lab 3.0.x\n\n```Shell\npip install tensorflow_model_analysis==0.32.0\njupyter labextension install tensorflow_model_analysis@0.32.0\npip install jupyterlab_widgets==1.0.0\n```\n\n\n#### Jupyter Lab 2.2.x\n\n```Shell\npip install tensorflow_model_analysis==0.32.0\njupyter labextension install tensorflow_model_analysis@0.32.0\njupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@2\n```\n\n#### Jupyter Lab 1.2.x\n\n```Shell\npip install tensorflow_model_analysis==0.32.0\njupyter labextension install tensorflow_model_analysis@0.32.0\njupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@1.1\n```\n\n#### Classic Jupyter Notebook\n\nTo enable TFMA visualization in the classic Jupyter Notebook (either through\n`jupyter notebook` or\n[through the JupyterLab UI](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/starting.html)),\nyou'll also need to run:\n\n```shell\njupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension\njupyter nbextension enable --py tensorflow_model_analysis\n```\n\nNote: If Jupyter notebook is already installed in your home directory, add\n`--user` to these commands. If Jupyter is installed as root, or using a virtual\nenvironment, the parameter `--sys-prefix` might be required.\n\n#### Building TFMA from source\n\nIf you want to build TFMA from source and use the UI in JupyterLab, you'll need\nto make sure that the source contains valid version numbers.  Check that the\nPython package version number and npm package version number are exactly the\nsame, and that both valid version numbers (eg, remove the `-dev` suffix).\n\n\n#### Troubleshooting\n\nCheck pip packages:\n\n```Shell\npip list\n```\n\nCheck JupyterLab extensions:\n\n```Shell\njupyter labextension list  # for JupyterLab\njupyter nbextension list  # for classic Jupyter Notebook\n```\n\n### Standalone HTML page with `embed_minimal_html`\n\nTFMA notebook extension can be built into a standalone HTML file that also\nbundles data into the HTML file.  See the Jupyter Widgets docs on\n[embed_minimal_html](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/embedding.html#python-interface).\n\n\n### Kubeflow Pipelines\n\n[Kubeflow Pipelines](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/sdk/output-viewer/)\nincludes integrations that embed the TFMA notebook extension ([code](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/blob/1.5.0-rc.2/backend/src/apiserver/visualization/types/tfma.py#L17)).\nThis integration relies on network access at runtime to load a variant of the\nJavaScript build published on unpkg.com (see [config](https://github.com/tensorflow/model-analysis/blob/v0.29.0/tensorflow_model_analysis/notebook/jupyter/js/webpack.config.js#L78)\nand [loader code](https://github.com/tensorflow/model-analysis/blob/v0.29.0/tensorflow_model_analysis/notebook/jupyter/js/lib/widget.js#L23)).\n\n\n### Notable Dependencies\n\nTensorFlow is required.\n\n[Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/) is required; it's the way that efficient\ndistributed computation is supported. By default, Apache Beam runs in local\nmode but can also run in distributed mode using\n[Google Cloud Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/) and other Apache\nBeam\n[runners](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/capability-matrix/).\n\n[Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) is also required. TFMA uses Arrow to\nrepresent data internally in order to make use of vectorized numpy functions.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nFor instructions on using TFMA, see the [get started\nguide](https://github.com/tensorflow/model-analysis/blob/master/g3doc/get_started.md).\n\n## Compatible Versions\n\nThe following table is the TFMA package versions that are compatible with each\nother. This is determined by our testing framework, but other *untested*\ncombinations may also work.\n\n|tensorflow-model-analysis

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
